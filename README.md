# School_District_Analysis

Using Python and NumPy, we clean and create meaningful data from which provide information regarding Schools Analysis. The focus of the analysis is to compare the reading score and math score between grades and schools, finding average and other measures of those scores, as well as the number of students for each schools and budgets for different school types.

The finding includes the average math score for all grades and schools is 65 and reading score is 75. The data was further analyzed by grades and school types with no evidence of one school type is better than the other. However, we found that budget for public schools is slightly higher than budget of charter schools.The analysis also shows that Montgomery High School has the most students enrolled with 2038 student and Chang High School has the least with 171 students enrolled.
